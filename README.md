# Pok√©mon Tracker
https://sekii.gitlab.io/pokemon-tracker

Project open to the public so feel free to fork or add new maps for other game gens. If you want to use the project offline, download the source code and open the file called "index.html" with your browser.

## Merge requests
I will accept any merge request to add new tracker maps for either new games or existing ones. The current maps are not meant to be 1 to 1 map of the seed randomization, so if you'd like to see more complete maps feel free to make and submit a new one and I'll most likely accept it.

Check the [open issues](https://gitlab.com/Sekii/pokemon-tracker/-/issues) to contribute code. I might not accept merge requests if they **needlessly** add dependencies or increase the complexity of the code.

## Tips and tools to make your own map
There is a debug mode and a specification of the map files available in the [following site](readme/make-your-own-map.md).
